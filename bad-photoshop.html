    <h1>"Bad" Photoshop</h1>
    <p>
    "Bad" Photoshop has become sensational over the last several years. As art has often made a tool out of irony, so does it with this type of purposefully messy creation. 
    For this project, I constructed three "Bad" Photoshop Composites influenced by <a href="https://www.lucasblalock.info/">Lucas Blalock's art</a>.</p>
    <p>
      To do this, I used several of Photoshop's core tools, including the eraser, layer mask, clone stamp, lasso, and more.
      Moreover, every image was taken by hand using my cell phone; nothing from the internet was used, which made for a challenge when locating crisp edges to mask and merge with other images.

      <h2>"Bad" Photoshop Samples</h2>
      <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image1.jpg" alt="Sample1" style="width:100%">
      <p>Bird's Nest.</p>
      <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image2.jpg" alt="Sample2" style="width:100%">
      <p>Technician.</p>
      <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image3.jpg" alt="Sample3" style="width:100%">
      <p>Mushroom Bowls.</p>

   <div class="Reference">
    <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image3_Ref1.jpeg" alt="Ref1" style="width:23%">
    <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image3_Ref2.jpeg" alt="Ref2" style="width:23%">
    <img src="Bad_Photoshop/BP_Image3_Ref3.jpeg" alt="Ref3" style="width:23%">
    <p>These are three of several images used to create Mushroom Bowls. It's obvious from the blurry effect surrounding each "bowl" that the Photoshop process used to merge these elements is less than perfect. However, like how the clicks and scratches of a record player are often emulated in modern music, the laughable flaws in a poorly-Photoshopped work are the first things one would want to emulate when paying homage to a certain art form. Its flaws are its most memorable characteristic.</p>
