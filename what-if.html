      <img src="What-If/Tokens.png" alt="Sample1" style="width:100%">
      <p>What is considered “magic” in this universe is really just energy manipulation.</p>
      <p>When energy is manipulated magically, it’s taken from somewhere else; i.e. if one wanted to produce light, the environment would become chillier due to the conversion of thermal energy to electromagnetic energy.</p>
      <p>There are seven different types of energy: mechanical, chemical, thermal, electrical, nuclear, electromagnetic, and sound. On the electromagnetic spectrum alone, there are several types of waves (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet (UV), X-rays, and gamma rays), and each does something different.</p>
      <p>If wave-particle duality as proposed by Louis de Broglie exists, then it’s possible particles of matter can be manipulated as well. This, however, has not been achieved by humans - yet. It has, however, been achieved by those who have been corrupted by the connection binding them to the dimension of energy; they become monsters.</p>
      <p>Energy systems are constantly trying to move to a balanced state, but monsters who have abused it just absorb it. By defying the law of energy conservation, these beings constantly seek more from any source that has it, including humans. Sometimes, electrons and photons even cake onto their skin; they’re prevented from escaping due to the sheer black-hole-like attraction pulling these particles ever closer. 
      </p><p>These beings bring chaos wherever they go, and are notoriously hard to eliminate. If a strong hero is able to literally over-power them, they can then sever their connection to either the physical or the energy dimension, leaving the monster a husk of their previous self.</p>
